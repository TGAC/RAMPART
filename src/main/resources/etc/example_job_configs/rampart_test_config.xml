    <!-- It is important that you specify what is known about the organism, whose data you are trying to assemble.  Some
         assemblers and other tools require that you specify the ploidy and estimated genome size.  For example an estimated
         genome size is required to subsample data to a particular level of coverage.  This organism information is also
         useful for logging and producing helpfully named scaffolds and contigs later. -->

         it is typical in many assembly projects to use multiple libraries with different insert size to build unitigs and
